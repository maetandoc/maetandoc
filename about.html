                    <p>Nice to meet you! My name is Mae, your personal pocket partner. In the midst of all the data-driven algorithms and analytics involved in small businesses, I am an artist and storyteller at heart... Oh! You want to know more?<br><br>So how did a little lady who graduated with a Pharmaceutical Business degree end up in the crazy world of small business and freelance?
<br>It all started with a little high school project called 愛Ichigo Latte Made &amp; Butler Cafe. I got the first taste of entrepreneurship when working with a team of talented individuals who helped me create a brand from the ground up. It was my pride and joy. <br>
<br>Alas, we all went to college and decided to disband. After initially going for a Pharmacy degree, I spent my days in class fuming over chemistry equations and drug interactions but my heart had always belonged to creating art, music, and telling stories. But life had always found a way to lead me to my purpose. So I decided to switch over in the business side of things. At least I can use it for my art, right? <br>
<br>I worked as a freelance singer and model during that time so I had to learn everything from the bottom up just to get a little bit of money here and there while I took on unpaid internships related to my newly-minted business degree choice. From social media to SEO to website building to sales and marketing, I learned a little bit of everything from hopping around all types of industries. <br>
<br>Heck, I even had a license to officially sell life and health insurance! 
<br>After graduating, can you believe it?! I actually got a job! I worked as a project manager for a startup company called NXTFactor that really honed my skills in digital marketing while I was blessed with the opportunity to work for huge restaurant clients like Chubby Cattle and The XPot. Guess those cafe skills really came to use now, huh? <br>
<br>Now, I am involved with the e-commerce brand ICHIEX as a partner and creative director while doing a little bit of freelancing on the side and building up my acting career. (Phew!) <br> 
<br>I pride in the fact that gaining these experiences contribute to my own development as an artist, a businesswoman, and just a plain, human being. Over the past few years, I have gained a deeper understanding that helping small businesses grow isn’t simply just for money. 
<br>
<br>It is for the people, the team, and the vision. And it is a personal value that I never lose sight of despite whatever life throws my way.&nbsp;<br></p>
